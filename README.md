**Crypto Watcher**

This project is a small web scraper of fetching data from coinmarketcap.com. Just run the following `crypto_watcher -c dogecoin` and this will print out in json format. If the name of the crypto you want to look at has a whitespace, replace the whitespace with a dash. For example `crypto_watcher -c shiba-inu`. This is my first completed rust project and I am still currently learning more about. Please feel free to fork it if you would like.
